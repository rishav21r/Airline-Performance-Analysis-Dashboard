# Enhancing Airline Performance Analysis for the Department of Transport
This repository contains a project for analyzing and visualizing flight delays in the US for the year 2015. The project includes data on flight delays, cancellations, and various factors affecting airline performance.

## Project Background
the Department of Transport has hired you and your consultancy team to present key performance indicators (KPIs) from airline performance data. The Department tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Despite having access to a vast array of data, the Department's management has had difficulty interpreting which data is critical for ongoing and future success.

## Objectives
- Identify 5 – 7 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Department of Transport.
- Create a single dashboard of information for management review.
- Visually display the KPIs and justify each KPI’s selection and design.
- Present trends, analysis, and patterns.

## Data
The data used in this project includes:
- `airports.csv`: Information about the airports.
- `airlines.csv`: Information about the airlines.
- `flights.csv`: Detailed flight data (not included due to size).

## Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard created for this project provides a comprehensive overview of flight delays, cancellations, and their reasons. Below is a screenshot of the dashboard:
